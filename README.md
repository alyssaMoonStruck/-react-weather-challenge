### Part One: Front-End Design

Use the mockup in the bottom section to create a front-end application using React.  This should be as pixel-perfect as possible. This include colors, fonts, and whitespace. Ensure your app is responsive for all screen sizes.

_Do not include any JavaScript functionality._

Once the above is complete, deploy your application to GH-Pages and slack your instructor with a link to the repo and the live site for a code review.

### Part Two: Connect With API

Allow your form to be submitted, and send the location in a request to OpenWeatherMap API.  You can read more about that here https://openweathermap.org/api.

Once the form is submitted, use the API response to display actual weather data for the location submitted in the form.

Once the above is complete, make sure your deployed application works the same and email your live application URL to the instructional team.

### Part Three: Add a Back End API

Launch express API.

Add a HomeTown property to a user that can be a string like "Boston, MA"

Test that a user can sign up, sign in, change password, sign out, and update their HomeTown.

### Part Four: Add Auth and HomeTown to React App

Update react app so when a user signs up they include their HomeTown.

Update react app so user has to log in to access the weather functionality.

Update react app so when user logs in, they see their hometown's data by default.
